# Project_Open_Residential
The objective of Project Open Residential is to restore the source code of Residential District, namely "ste.mis" and ALL the missions therein from the partially decompiled ste.scr.

To get the compiled code, just extract "ste.mis" and the folder "ste" together and run "ste.mis" in the miss2.exe compiler (made by DMA Design).

To install this open source version of Residential District into GTA2, just drag "ste.scr" into /GTA2/data/ and all other .SCR missions compiled files to /GTA2/data/ste/

**OBSERVATION**: You **must** copy those .SCR missions compiled files (such as ste_end.scr, ste_re1.scr etc) to /GTA2/data/ste/ in order to it work. Any desynchronization between ste.scr and its missions files in /GTA2/data/ste/ will potentially lead to a crash.

You can change the counter "fix_wang_cars_glitch" to restore or fix the duplicate glitch of wang cars that is present on v9.6.

The version 0.3.0 is 100% functional. The version 1.0.0 will release when the most important global variables or functions (such as saved counters, triggers, subroutines etc) get appropriate names. If you want to make little modifications in Residential District, such as token randomizer, you can already do it. However if you want to make big changes in Residential District, it is sensible to wait for the version 1.0.0.
